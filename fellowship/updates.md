* Published a tool: http://csv.codingnews.info/ - csv to html table, alright! AWESOME! coool!!
* Blog post: http://codingnews.info/post/csv-to-table.html
    **what made you build it?**

    One day, a reporter said "oh, we need to publish this table." And he said we had one hour to do it. Even with a tool, it took me an hour and a half to build the table, and I thought that was crazy. We do that all the time! I'm going to bulid a tool for this because it doesn't make any sense. That's what inspired me.
